Numerical simulation of long-term earthquake cycles on a two-dimensional vertical strike-slip fault with dynamic treatment of inertial effects. Written in [Julia](https://julialang.org).

## Current Status
Under development. Working on MPI based parallelization.

## Features
- Antiplane strain deformation on planar fault with SH waves
- Fully dynamic treatment of seismic events
- Rate-and-state-dependent friction with aging laws 
- Adaptive time-stepping to switch between interseismic and seismic events
- Customizable to include off-fault and on-fault heterogeneites
- Complex geometry of fault damage zones including gaussian and trapezoid fault damage zones
- Time-dependent healing of fault damage zones constrained by observations

## Dependencies
- [Julia version >= 1.1](https://julialang.org)
- [Algebraic Mulltigrid](https://github.com/JuliaLinearAlgebra/AlgebraicMultigrid.jl)
- [Iterative Solvers](https://github.com/JuliaMath/IterativeSolvers.jl)
- [FEMSparse](https://github.com/ahojukka5/FEMSparse.jl)

## Quickstart guide
1. Install Julia >= 1.1 (preferably the latest version).
2. Run `install_dependencies.jl` script to install the specific packages.
3. Open `run.jl` and edit the output file name and the resolution of the problem.
4. Run `run.jl` from the terminal or IDE of your choice.
5. The output files are saved in `data/$(simulation_name)`.
6. You can look at the output file from `analyze_results.jl`.
7. For basic testing run `julia tests/basic_test_01.jl` to look at two plots saved in the `plots/$(simulation_name)` directory.
